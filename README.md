#Anonymous federated learning

These codes demonstrate a proof-of-concept for a novel federated learning technique. To assess the efficacy of the proposed framework, we evaluate it on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using the Bi-LSTM model. Notably, the framework leverages the exchange of small-sized modules to achieve high accuracy, low communication and computation costs, and personalized models.
